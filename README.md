# TravelGlobe

Travel Globe is my project for Web Developement (CS-5610) course under Prof. Jose Annunziato. It's a portal that provides information about recommended places and reviews by users of any city across the globe. The APIs used are: Foursquare, openweathermap, googlemap and googleimages. 

List of Functionalities:
- Login: User can create an account to add a review, edit profile, send message etc
- Search: User can search for any city across the globe, see reviews by other users and can add his review too.
- City Attractions: User can see the city details which shows top 30 recommended food, drinks, attractions and shopping places
- Review: User can add a review and can also see reviews added by other users
- Follow/Unfollow: User can follow or unfollow other users and see them in his dashboard
- Send private message: User can send private messages to other users and can see them in inbox
